#Ripples.js--from [bootstrap-material-design](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design)

This is a module from FezVrasta's awesome project "bootstrap-material-design", I love it so much, but he doesn't take it out as one whole project and there isn't so much document for it.

So I forked it, modified and improved a lit bit so it can use directly, and write some document for it. 

Hope you guys like it and thanks a lot for FezVrasta's awesome job

## DEMO

[Life demo](http://xiaoyuze88.github.io/demo/ripples.js/)

## Dependence

`Jquery`

## Usage

Include `ripples.js` and `ripples.css` in your html file.

Then initilize it by:
    
    <!--html-->
    <div class="button"></div>

    // JavaScript
    $('.button').ripples();

By default, the ripple's color will be set to elements' font color, you can define your own color by adding a `data-ripple-color` attribute.

    <div class="button" data-ripple-color="rgb(200,200,200)"></div>

## AGAIN

These code is forked from FezVrasta's [bootstrap-material-design](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design), as he doesn't set a repository for his Ripples.js, I can't contribute my code for it. 

Put it here just wanna more people know his awesome job and hope you'll like it.
